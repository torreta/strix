Strix Demo
=========== 
### Welcome! Have a quick read of this 
 
hi, this is a showcase made to impress my coworkers, it might not be much, but it was meant to be simple and explainable so
i could make a quick look of rails benefits, also, i will try to merge a couple of another technologies to show the potencial 
of the tool. 

if u get confused, just ask XD (those next line are there to remember me how to write markup language)
 
> ## How to make it run or test at least 
>  1. Clone the git project, or download it, however you want 
>  2. Get into the project folder via command terminal (did you unzip it, right?) 
>  3. Run `  bundle install`  
>  4. Run ` rake db:create` (just in case...) 
>  5. Run ` rake db:migrate` (at this point, if nothing has exploded, we are fine XD) 
>  6. Run ` rake db:seed` (just populating the database a little bit) 
>  7. Run ` rails server` (now, everything should be ready to test on localhost:3000)
